# Rock paper scissors

## assignment
Implement a version of the game Rock-Paper-Scissors (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors )


## my comments
 I originally planned to keep the implementation quite rigid and very simple - any modifications to the rules would alter the game so much that it would lose its meaning. However, from the wikipedia article provided I found out that there is a variation in France with the fourth move - a well (which makes zero sense, now some moves are statistically more viable than the others!) , and I also realized that it's not much extra work to make it robust anyway, so I made it in a way to easily add more moves like the well to the project.
The requirements were quite vague, so I decided to implement it as a command line game against an AI opponent. The project can be extended to include more AI player strategies as well.
